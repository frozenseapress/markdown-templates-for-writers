## PROJECTS

These should be either major projects or key steps in a larger project; this also should be a fluid list where items get bumped quarters or changed or deleted; the key thing is that they should be something that can be completed within three months at the most

## TASKS 

### CURRENT TO-DOs ###

Note that if you want to keep a record, you can move your weekly tasks to a separate document that archives everything by year, month, and week (or just week). I don't see why you'd need to do that, but you can. Just don't let more than a month's worth pile up below. Any tasks that you didn't get done at the end of a week get bumped to the next week or deleted. Note that instead of check markes you could just use bullet points and add the date to the end of the task when you complete it. Or some other method. The key is to keep things simple but information dense. 


#### CREATIVE WORK NEXT

* I like to have a list of three to five items here that relate to my projects for the quarter as a reminder of what I either need or want to work on next. I then will add them to a weekly task list either after I do them or in a week I know I really want or need to complete them.  

#### AUGUST 3 - 9 (next week)

- [ ] This should only be tasks that have to be done exactly that week for timing reasons (say, for example, a submissions window opens)

#### JULY 27 - AUGUST 2 (current week)

- [x] Task 1 
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

### JULY 20 - 26 (last week)

- [x] Task 1 
- [x] Task 2
- [x] Task 3



## SOMEDAY/MAYBE

These should be items that aren't a primary focus of your writing but could be related to it or are just other things that would help your overall creative life. Tasks should be something that's feasible and either fun to do or related to your overall infrastructure/information environment that will make your life easier in the long run, but aren't critical to accomplish. Projects would require listing out additional steps.
