Wm Henry Morris uses markdown/text files for all of his fiction and nonfiction writing as well as for tracking projects and to-do lists. 

This repository provides templates that anyone can use (and alter to better suit their specific use case). 

These templates will work best in editors that can render markdown language, but can also be used as simple text files (change the file extension from .md to .txt).
