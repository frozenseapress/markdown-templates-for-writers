# Short Story Template

LAST UPDATE: August 2025 by [WHM](https://frozenseapress.com/)



Put any general notes about the story here, including metadata (genre, final length, date of final completion, where it was eventually published, world that exists in if it's set in a world you're writing other fiction in, etc.).



#### RANKED LIST OF SUBMISSIONS

Note: this table may not work in some text editors. It'd probably be easier and wiser to track your submissions in [The Submissions Grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/), but having at the very list the top three markets you want to target here in the document could be helpful inspiration and guidance on things like length, tone, genre, etc. as you write/polish the story.

### DRAFT ZERO

This is where the kernel of your story idea and any brainstorming and outlines go. If your text editor has an outline menu, you should be able to quickly click between this section and whichever draft your're one.

And because it may be useful, I've included my approach to writing stories down here in draft zero along with numerous ways other authors/narrative theorists have described story structure (prescriptively or not).



#### WHM method for writing short stories

1. One line that intrigues you (could be an opening line, a line of dialogue, something that describes a character, the ending, a weird idea for a setting, a poetic image; basically, it's anything that grabs your imagination)
2. One more interesting idea (stated as messily and vaguely as you want it to be)
3. A rough idea of what the first scene should be
4. A vague sense of tone/voice (this can be developed as you write the first scene and may take until the second or third scene to snap into focus [in which case, go back and rewrite the previous scenes to match before continuing further]) 

And then you just start writing the first scene and then when that's done either write the second or stop and keep thinking about the story. As other ideas come to you, including ideas for future scenes or the ending, you jot them down here in Draft Zero. Maybe you even write some background notes about the characters or setting. Or you decided to make a point of view change or write a note about tone. But the idea is to keep things loose and just document what comes to mind. Don't try to develop too far or you may find that your story is too on the rails and that will cause you to become bored and stop writing. 

Of course, if you are the type of writer who prefers more structure, you may want to use one of the story structures/outline formats below (or copy and paste the structure you prefer here into this template).

**MORE ON VOICE/TONE**

Because I think this is the most important part of a story, here are my notes on what Theodora Goss has to say about voice (on the Odyssey Workshop podcast). Also see [Samatar and Zambreno on Tone](https://wmhenrymorris.com/nonfiction/Tone-Samatar-Zambreno.html).

Goss:

Voice is comprised of...

1. Density -- sentences need to multi-task. Is each sentence doing at least two things? Advancing plot, showing character, deepening setting, illustrating style. [WHM add this note: don't underestimate the value of sentences that serve to illustrate style]

2. Authenticity -- your voice should not sound like a parody of something; don't try to write like something you're not. [but WHM adds this caveat: don't lock yourself into one tone; short stories, in particular, are a place to experiment with voice/tone]

3. Authority -- the reader should trust you; never throw your reader out of the book; don't jar the reader out of the spell. Sentences, words or punctuation: know your tools well. [but WHM add this caveat: it's harder to pull off, but have an adverserial approach to the reader can be a a valid approach]



#### Outline Format A: Freytag's Pyramid

1. Exposition

2. Rising Action

3. Climax

4. Falling Action

5. Resolution

   

#### Outline Format B: Three-Act Structure

(not my cup of tea, but including it here because it is widely use)

Act 1: Setup – exposition, including the inciting incident

Act 2: Confrontation – rising action, often characterized by a series of try-fail cycles

Act 3: Resolution – climax and denouement



#### Outline Format C: Hero's Journey (Dan Harmon's version)

Dan Harmon is an asshole, but he also has articulated the hero's journey approach to storytelling in a way that makes sense to me more than other folks who've tried to explain it. Also: I'm sorry if this ruins Community for you, but (almost?) every episode uses this structure. 

1. A character is in a zone of comfort, -- ESTABLISH A PROTAGONIST
2. But they want something. -- SOMETHING AIN'T QUITE RIGHT
3. They enter an unfamiliar situation, -- CROSSING THE THRESHOLD
4. Adapt to it, -- THE ROAD OF TRIALS
5. Get what they wanted, -- MEETING WITH THE GODDESS
6. Pay a heavy price for it, -- MEET YOUR MAKER
7. Then return to their familiar situation, -- BRINGING IT HOME
8. Having changed. -- MASTER OF BOTH WORLDS

OR:

* You (a character is in a zone of comfort)
* Need (but they want something)
* Go (they enter an unfamiliar situation)
* Search (adapt to it)
* Find (find what they wanted)
* Take (pay its price)
* Return (and go back to where they started)
* Change (now capable of change)



#### Outline Format D: 7-Point Story Structure 

(I see this most often attributed to Dan Wells, but it could also be an adaptation of Algys Budrys's seven point story structure)

1. Hook (pithy first line and/or intriguing setting and/or cool character)

2. Plot turn 1- introduce the conflict.

3. Pinch 1- something goes wrong. 

4. Midpoint- main character moves from reaction to action. 

5. Pinch 2- situation becomes hopeless. The Jaws of Defeat. The death of a mentor, a plan fails, the villain seems to win. 

6. Plot turn 2- main character obtains the vital piece of info/courage/item they need to vanquish the villain

7. Resolution



#### Outline Format E:  Mary Robinette Kowal's Roadmap

Note that this seems to be akin to the snowflake structure approach that's popular among certain writers (or at least among certain writers blogging about writing)

- CORE IDEA: one sentence; just an idea, a sentence or two

- THUMBNAIL SKETCH: more developed; has beginning, middle, and end, but is just a sketch

- ROUGH SKETCH/SYNOPSIS: expanded version of the thumbnail sketch

- OUTLINE: turn the synopsis into a list of scenes 



#### Outline Format F: The Lit Fic Approach

Note that this is something I just made up and often is pointed out as a tired out even exhausted structure, but also: it can still work at times, especially if you take this as a starting point and mess with it in various directions. 

1. A character is in a state of stasis
2. Something happens that causes them to be aware of desires they hadn't previously been conscious of
3. One or more things happen that twist or complicate or thwart or intensify that desire
4. This leads to either action or inaction on the main character's part
5. Something either suddenly or slowly unfolds in response to that action or inaction (or happen by chance) and that leads to an epiphany
6. The story either ends with the epiphany or with a bit of introspection from the main character on that epiphany or a striking image or line or metaphor or action that indicates what the character is going to do/not do with that epiphany
